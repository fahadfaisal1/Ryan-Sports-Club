  <!-- information -->
  <p class="info">Squash has famously been dubbed 'the world's healthiest sport' and it is famous for pushing
    player's strength, balance and agility to the limit.It has also been compared to even some of the most energetic
    high intensity workouts but it's actually a fun sport and also very beneficial for health as it reduces
    the risk of heart disease.
    <br><br>
    A facility of well-maintained three all weather squash courts are available. The squash complex has a calm and quiet
    lounge. Qualified and experienced coaches are also available. Regular touurnaments are also held.

    <li>Stand with one foot in either service box
      Hit the ball to the front wall landing it above the service line, below the out line

      The ball can rebound off other walls or be hit on the full (a volley)</li>
      <li>The ball MUST hit the front wall each shot but can hit other walls before or after
        The opponent must hit the ball before the 2nd bounce
        Players can hit the ball before it bounces on the floor (a volley)
        Players can use all of the court after the serve is hit, there are no restrictions on where to run</li>
      <li>When it hits the tin or out line
        When it hits above the out of court line (on a serve or during a rally)
        When it bounces on the floor more than once before being hit
        When a serve lands in the incorrect area (a fault)</li>
      <li>The player who wins the rally scores a point
        A game goes up to 11 points, if the score is 10 all the game continues until a player wins by 2 points
